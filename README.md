# TensorFusionNetwork-CMU_MOSI

I merge the pytorch implementation version of Tensor fusion network [TFN](https://github.com/Justin1904/TensorFusionNetworks) and CMU-MOSI dataset preprocessing [CMU-MultimodalSDK-Tutorials](https://github.com/Justin1904/CMU-MultimodalSDK-Tutorials/blob/master/tutorial_interactive.ipynb), such that tensor fusion network can run on the latest version of CMU-MOSI dataset.

The following part is the README.txt in CMU-MultimodalSDK-Tutorials:

This is a short tutorial for using the [CMU-MultimodalSDK](https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK).

First of all you need to download the SDK from [here](https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK).

After that you will need to clone this repo and set up some file paths in `./constants/paths.py`. The comments there should be self-explanatory.

If you have downloaded pretrained embeddings such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) on your hard drive, you can setup the path to them in `./constants/paths.py` for improved performance.

Note that in the `./data/` directory there is a `./CMU_MOSI_ModifiedTimestampedWords.csd`. This is an updated copy of transcripts compared to what the [SDK](https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK) is currently offering by default and improves the performance by a observable margin. If you are changing the `DATA_PATH` in `./constants/paths.py`, please also copy this file to your specified location.

Then you are good to go, just open the `./tutorial_interactive.ipynb` notebook in jupyter notebook and walk through its content!
